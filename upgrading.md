## Upgrading your service
{: #service} 

To upgrade your plan from Lite to Advanced:

1. Open the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard](https://console.{DomainName}/dashboard). 
1. Click on your {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} service instance to open the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} service dashboard.
1. From the **Manage** page of your {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} service, click **Upgrade** to choose the Advanced plan. This will open the **Plan** page. Follow the steps to complete your upgrade. 
1. Return to the **Manage** page and click **Launch Tool** to open the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} tooling.
   - If you had never created an environment for your Lite plan before the upgrade to Advanced, click the ![Cog](images/icon_settings.png) icon and choose **Create environment**. A screen will display the options for your Advanced plan. Choose the one that fits your needs.  (`X-Small`, `Small`, `Medium-Small`, `Medium`, `Medium-Large`, `Large`, `X-Large`, `XX-Large`).
   - If you had created an environment for your Lite plan before the upgrade to Advanced, your new Advanced plan environment will be `Small` by default.
